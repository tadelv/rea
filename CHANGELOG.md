## Hello and welcome to REA!

REA is an app to control your DE1, based on Despresso.
It's still in development, so there will be rough edges, beware 😅

### What's different?

- Profiles editing, limiter settings, create new Profiles
- Coffee beans and roasters editing has been simplified a bit
- Support for same keyboard behavior as the original de1 app
- Slightly changed user interface
- Recipes screen simplification, the ratio setting

I hope you will like it!
